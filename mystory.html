      <P>
      I'm a father, a husband and soon to be a senior!  I spent 25 plus years as a helicopter pilot, working my way up through the ranks.  Only to get hit with a medical condition that would
      ultimately send me on a search for a new purpose.  I never thought that I was going to end my career this way, but who really thinks that these things are going to happen to them.
      Surely, not I!<br>
      <p>
      I was not really prepared for this, but by the grace of God, I began paying for long term disability, 2 years prior to this event.  The company paid for short-term disability
      but long-term was optional.  I fortunately paid for long term, even though I remember questioning whether it was worth it or not.  Only 8 months prior to this event, during open
      enrollment I nearly dropped it.  When the event occured I frantically checked to see If I had continued it or not.  Praise Jesus, I had, I was covered!  What a relieve that was, let me tell
      you!
      <p>
      I started looking for other options and something technology related was the direction I began looking in.  I thought that with my talent and years of experience with computers this would
      be a good place to concentrate my efforts.  I quickly learned that I was way behind the power curve.  Without a degree and some formal education a career in information technology would be
      a long shot a best.  I alson realized that setting up computers, troubleshooting and repair was not really what I would enjoy doing.  In the process of my search I stumbled upon advertisements
      for coding boot camps.  This sparked an interest and I began to investigate just what coding was.  Up untill now I didn't realy even know what coding was.
